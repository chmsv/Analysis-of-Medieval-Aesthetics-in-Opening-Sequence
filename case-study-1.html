        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          To immerse the spectator in the space of a picture set in the Middle
          Ages, the directors often turned to the image of a book. This imagery
          is not just visually eye-catching. It is a bridge connecting cinema to
          medieval storytelling traditions, a nod to the source material that
          lends the story a sense of historical grounding. Any movie begins with
          a script, and in the case of my subject, with a literary basis,
          whether it is legends, novels, fairy tales, or poems. Putting a book
          in the space of the film seemingly authorized it, made it more
          “veritable”, tied it to a material and semantic entity, i.e. a book.
        </p>
        <p>
          This case study explores particular instances when a book as an object
          – whether its cover or pages – is used in the opening credits of
          movies from the database. How are these books presented? To what
          extent do they correlate with the time in which the action of the film
          unfolds, capturing the essence of the period? How is the association
          with the movie and the past shown in it made? These are the questions
          that this chapter sets out to answer.
        </p>

          Will Straw in his article on film credits incorporated into the city’s
          architecture and skyline states that “[t]he credit sequences of
          classical and preclassical cinema will almost always model themselves
          on the printed page, the theatrical curtain, or the emblematic
          slide.”<a

          This assertion, however, is rather misleading in relation to the
          sample of films which are presented in this study. Among the 103 films
          released before 1964 that used medieval aesthetics in their titles,
          only 12 use the image of a book and turning pages – that is only ~12%.
          It cannot be claimed that this figure indicates a trend, but it is not
          worth ignoring the number of titles that follow the same pattern.
          Slightly, but not critically higher, is the percentage of such titles
          in movies with scripts that have a literary basis: eight out of 58
          films, that is ~14%. By literary basis, it refers to a wide range of
          sources from epics and legends to newspaper comics.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this selection, a marginally more general example is deliberately
          omitted. This is a separate category of title cards that appears to be
          hanging on the path to the representation of the book as a physical
          object, i.e. titles imitating parchment or scroll. There are enough
          examples of such films in the database used<a

          The earliest available film with credits that imitate (or only attempt
          to) a book, came out in 1935, the latest (certainly strictly within
          the sample) in 1959. Two films each came out in 1954 and 1957, with
          the most movies – seven – released in the 1950s. 58% of the movies in
          this case study are shot in black and white, exactly seven out of 12.
          If all instances for a selection of all the films in the whole paper
          are factored into the statistics, the percentage drops to 38%, i.e.
          only 40 films out of 103 are black and white. Important to specify
          that it considers tinted black and white films to be color films by
          this criterion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of films analyzed in this case study includes nine films
          whose screenplay is based on a literary source. In almost all
          instances, these are pieces written long after the events portrayed.
          One exception is
          <em>The Iron Swordsman</em> (1949) which is based on a short episode
          about the life of the Italian nobleman Ugolino della Gherardesca told
          in Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. A second example set shortly before
          the literary basis is
          <em>Wonderful Adventures of Guerrin Meschino</em> (1952) based on a
          chivalry romance from the 15th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seven of the dozen films are set in the 15th century, three examples
          are from the 13th century, and one described events from the 14th
          century. The strict chronological limits of another film are not
          specified in the story or in the sources that have arisen around that
          film and are currently available, but fall between the 8th and 10th
          centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The locations of the films are quite predictable: most of the films
          are about France (four films), followed by Italy and Germany (three
          each), then England and Scandinavia (one each). This ratio is not
          unexpected. These countries were the leaders in film production, along
          with the United States, and their focus was concentrated on local
          history. In post-war Germany there was even a name for such a genre,
          Heimatfilm. It includes plot-driven, simple romantic movies that tell
          a straightforward story of love and friendship in a village setting.
          The perfect type for Medieval movies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the country of production, the supremacy of the United
          States is undeniable and also unsurprising. The selection analyzed in
          this chapter consists of films released between 1935 and 1959. The
          shift towards advanced capitalism in the US film industry is dated by
          some film historians to the period between 1919 and 1935.<a

          Changes in film budgeting schemes, bankruptcies and mergers of
          production companies eventually led to the very form of the classic
          Hollywood style of shooting and production as we know it. The telling
          of universal stories as the main formal goal, the revisiting,
          reworking and adaptation of different narratives, the gravitation
          towards clear and unambiguous plots. David Bordwell consciously
          compares the movie studios of that era to monastic scriptoria.<a

          However, Hollywood had production facilities that medieval monks could
          never have dreamed of.

          As Richard Burt notes, the study of the so-called elements of
          “cinematic paratext,” which include opening credits, offers a fresh
          look at the relationship between medieval book culture and cinema as
          old and new channels of media communication<a
            href="#fn5"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref5"
            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>5</sup></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first movie in the selection in which the opening credits are
          presented in the pages of a book is
          <em>Adémaï in the Middle Ages</em> (1935). The book here occupies the
          entire space of the frame, the spectators see nothing but the pages
          being turned. This “book” is nominal but there is no doubt that it was
          the “book” effect that the creators of the titles were trying to
          achieve. Some pages have small illustrations, made in a much more
          modern manner than the font. In the shot with the film title an image
          of a fortress is placed in the background, which does not correlate
          with the aesthetics of the font. Interestingly, when listing the
          supporting and third actors, the sheet turns into a scroll moving from
          bottom to top. After the shots with the names of the crew there is a
          montage effect of “flipping” rather than, as it was in the beginning,
          the obviously manual turning the pages.

          The typeface used for the credits certainly refers to Gothic minuscule
          and to some intermediate variant between Gothic Textura Prescissa,

          The opening titles were painted by hand and the artist has undoubtedly
          introduced new artistic elements into it, relying on the traditional
          handwriting that is ubiquitous in European manuscripts, especially
          those found in what is now France and Spain, from the 12th to the 15th
          century. This font is the highest grade of the Gothic range of
          bookhands. The film is set in the late 1420s, so this stylization of
          the credits looks justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chronologically following is
          <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> (1939), the US production. Frames
          of the opening credits are changed using a montage, and on the credits
          with the film crew becomes a scroll as in the previous example. The
          film is set in the late Middle Ages, but from the credits this dating
          is not clear. The serif font looks printed and stylistically refers
          rather to the books of the middle of the 19th century or, a little
          later, to the private press movement. On the other hand, the authors
          may have been inspired by the title pages of editions of
          <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em>. However, no similar design was found
          among the various editions of Victor Hugo’s novel available online.

          What stylistic features, adopted from manuscripts and printed books
          and reworked by artists, can be seen in the opening title pages? The
          title is in two colors. First, the ornamented capital letters “H”,
          “N”, and “D” grab the attention. They are an example of so-called
          <em>fleuronée</em> decoration, which is a special case of the broader
          term <em>penflourishing</em> or <em>penwork</em
          ><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>7</sup></a
          >. The design extends above and below the letter space, the
          <em>filigrée</em> initials being the centerpiece. This type of initial
          decoration is one of the oldest and was common throughout the whole
          Middle Ages. The popularity was due to the use of only two colors, the
          relative ease of execution compared to more complex forms, and the
          guaranteed results. The second aesthetic element is the simple
          abstract ornamentation around the perimeter of the page margins. It
          does not resemble the typical ornaments found in manuscripts of the
          late Middle Ages, in which the events of the novel unfold<a
            href="#fn8"
            class="footnote-ref"

            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>8</sup></a
          >, but more resembles part of the <em>bandeau</em> ornaments that were
          usually located at the beginning of a chapter of printed books.

          Therefore, the credits of <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> are a
          far from authentic stylization that does not refer to anything
          specific but a fine blend of different aesthetics, yet significantly
          modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more stylistically interesting example is the credits of
          <em>The Devil’s Envoys</em> (1942). This film often appears in papers
          analyzing medievalism and filmic incarnations of the Middle Ages<a
            href="#fn9"

            ><sup>9</sup></a

          attention, make the viewer look at the book. The credits do not skimp
          on ornamentation and decoration.

          The action takes place in 1485 in France which is told to us in the
          introduction by a manuscript page, that is similar in its function to
          the intertitle of a silent movie. This page follows the opening
          credits, also written in the book. In the first shot, the spectator is
          presented with the lavishly embellished book cover. This elaborate
          <em>plaque</em> (or plate) is attached to the book-cover within which
          the caption pages are enclosed. The <em>plaque</em> comprises a
          central plate surrounded by ornaments made of gemstones and painted
          patterns. The central element is an <em>appliquée</em> image, a
          portrait of a woman, framed by a simple metal and ivory-like inner
          frame. The woman wears a high pointed hennin with a white veil. It is
          an extravagant choice of noble European women of the late Middle Ages,
          beginning in the 1430s. Such headdress was especially common in
          France, Burgundy and Flanders<a

          This cover design (with inlay, ivory, metal, and ornaments) often was
          characteristic of liturgical books. Examples of such design are found
          before and after the Middle Ages. Usually the central element was the
          figure of Jesus or the Crucifixion. However, there are examples of
          similar designs in non-liturgical literature as well<a

          As with <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> the pages are turned,
          however in this movie the spectators see the hands that do it. This
          first-person filming accomplishes a more immersive experience of
          interacting with the opening credits. The title card is decorated with
          plane plant ornamentation around the perimeter of the page; the title
          itself includes decorated initials. The lettering is hand-drawn and
          stylistically influenced by the Gothic script system. Such
          inscriptions were used in books produced in monastic scriptorium.<a

          particular period. The letter “V”, however, is out of the overall
          style: its drawing does not correspond to the common norms, besides,
          the letter “U” was usually used for initials.

          Overall, the credits for <em>The Devil’s Envoys</em> can be considered
          a curious example of working with a depicted era and skillfully
          integrating its characteristics into the space of the opening credits.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opening sequence of <em>The Black Arrow</em> (1948) is organized
          similarly. Its design, however, from the very first frame casts doubt
          on the adherence to the 15th century aesthetics in which the events of
          the film took place. The book shown in the credits has the so-called
          half-binding (or <em>demi-reliure</em>) which did not emerge until the
          19th century.

          The title credits of <em>The Iron Swordsman</em> (1949), directly
          refer to one of the most famous editions of Dante Alighieri’s
          <em>Divine Comedy</em>. The movie tells the story of Ugolino della
          Gherardesca, an Italian nobleman placed by Dante in the second circle
          of hell for betraying his homeland. The movie opens with a shot of a
          19th century book, on the title page of which is inscribed in Gothic
          script “<em>Dante. La Divina Comedia.</em>”

          Ugolino. The image enlarges, filling the frame space, and a caption
          with the title appears. Interestingly, its font follows the design of
          the first American edition of the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, published in
          Italian in 1867<a

          The first color film to use the book in its credits that is an

          The movie is based on the 1893 novel of the same name by Ludwig

          credits: the first one meets us on the cover of the book, the second
          is on a page after the credits with the names of the film crew.

          Before our eyes is undoubtedly a book from the late 19th century. This
          is evidenced by the usual landscape orientation and the title directly
          on the cover. A resembling font is found in the first edition of the
          novel<a

          Both of these cases are artistic embodiments of the Fraktur typeface,
          which originated around the 1510s in Nuremberg and is the most
          recognizable typeface<a
            href="#fn24"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref24"
            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>24</sup></a
          >
          used for more than four centuries on the German territories<a
            href="#fn25"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref25"
            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>25</sup></a
          >. Fraktur refers to strict Gothic script in its letterforms but it
          was already widespread in printed books. The authors of the title card
          to <em>The Monastery’s Hunter</em> have used it freely (take for
          example the unusual lettering of the letter “a”), while leaving
          recognizable features (wide lines, elongated letters). And again here
          we find decorative capital letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fittingly, the trend with more modern books continues with
          <em>The Saracen Blade</em> (1954). The cover of the book, decorated
          with the title of the movie, looks contemporary to the time of the
          movie. This is evidenced by the book’s landscape orientation<a
            href="#fn26"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref26"
            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>26</sup></a
          >, which is not typical of the Middle Ages, and the Bradel binding,
          which was not used until the 18th century. The cover looks comic, it
          promises bright fairytale adventures, although the plot of the movie
          cannot be called absolutely detached from the historical perspective.
          The title of the movie is made of different scripts: there are the
          letterforms we have already seen in T<em>he Iron Swordsman</em>, which
          are used for capital letters, and a stricter Gothic variant,
          gravitating towards Textualis semi-quadrata. In this movie, more than
          in any of those previously reviewed, comes such a clumsy
          representation of the book titles.

          Director Roberto Rossellini puts the title sequence in the eighth
          minute of <em>Joan of Arc at the Stake</em> (1954), right after the
          opening scene of the burning at the stake. This movie is filled with
          music, it introduces the audience from the very beginning, so the use
          of musical notation motifs in the title credits is justified and sets
          the tone for the narrative. The title shot is interesting for several
          reasons. Firstly, the use of letter colors, which has departed from
          the conventional use of color. Red and black (or dark brown) have been
          swapped.

          During the Middle Ages red color was more often used for rubrication,
          the very term “rubric” came from the Latin meaning “red”. This color
          was most noticeable in the dark lines rows of the text and helped the
          reader to navigate the pages of the manuscript<a

            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>27</sup></a
          >. However, it was not uncommon for red to be used to highlight an
          entire piece of text rather than using just a capital letter<a

          Other colors such as blue or gilt were used to headline text written
          in red. The title <em>Joan of Arc at the Stake</em> inverts this
          commonly used trop – the capital letters are set off in dark color,
          while the rest of the word is written in red. The typeface itself is
          an artistic fantasy. Secondly, the capital letters “J” and “S” are
          accompanied by a modest penwork flourishing that does not resemble the
          usual manuscript patterns. Third, it is curious to consider musical
          notation. Modern musical notation emerged in the 11th century in
          Italy, attributed to Guido d’Arezzo. Notation in the time of Joan of
          Arc looked different<a

          The second musical film in the selection,
          <em>The Pied Piper of Hamelin</em> (1957) appealing to an older
          Germanic legend about the salvation of the city, is treated loosely in
          the opening credits. The audience is greeted by a leather-bound book
          with the film’s title inscribed on the cover in gilded letters in late
          Gothic script. Inside, on the book’s pages, the font becomes even more
          modern in parts when the film crew is listed, and the credits are
          linked to the legendary story only by decorated capital letters in red
          and blue.

          (1957) is distinguished not only by the length of its title, but also
          by its setting. The action takes place in Scandinavia between the 8th
          and 10th century. The framework is too broad but for a fantasy movie
          about battling a dragon-like sea serpent, that is not a huge
          assumption. The book is leather bound, and the centerpiece of the
          cover is a Viking ship, made either in gilt, like a super ex-libris,
          or metal. It is embedded in a metal ornamental frame around the
          perimeter of the cover. On the first page the audience is met by the
          film title written in a script too late for the events described. But
          that is what a saga is for, to be kept alive and transmitted to future
          generations. The title is typed in Gothic script, which is more of a
          late medieval typeface, as evidenced by the smoother, thinner lines.

          The credits of <em>The Shepherd from Trutzberg</em> (1959) almost echo
          <em>The Monastery’s Hunter</em>. The same hypertrophied recognizable
          Fraktur, the same red capital letters. The cover is adorned with a
          modernized coat of arms, executed in four colors. The similarity of
          the titles of these two films is not accidental: their plots are close
          chronologically, and both films are based on the literary works of
          Ludwig Ganghofer.
